You can now detect bad modders with this script.

Detect all bad modders that are online in your session or in your next sesion with this script.

The script will scan all of the player present in your session and check if someone is on the list that regroups all of registered bad modders.

The script will do different scans, With the names of the Socialclub's modder (Wich you should NOT to put your trust on)

With the RID (Cannot be changed so you CAN put your trust on it) 

With RID and Socialclub name (You CAN 100% count on it)

Very regular updates to continually add bad modders.

To prevent abuse, bad modders will be added by myself. You can send them to me via private message following this format:

NAME + RID + photo or video evidence of the modder's actions
